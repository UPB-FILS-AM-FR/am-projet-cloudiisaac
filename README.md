## Description
The "Turn the Light First" project is a project that aims to control the ignition of a light using an electronic system. This is a practical project that can be adapted to different applications, such as automatic lighting in a room, a light alarm system, or a security system.

## Motivation
turn the light first" peut provenir d'une combinaison de satisfaction personnelle, d'apprentissage, de créativité, d'utilité pratique et de plaisir.
## Architecture
The necessary components, such as relays or transistors, are integrated to activate and deactivate the light according to the microcontroller's signals.

Microcontroller programming:

Programming of the microcontroller to control the operation of the light according to the defined conditions.

We use control instructions to turn the light on and off in response to specific stimuli, such as sensor signals or user controls.

Integration of sensors (if applicable):

We can use sensors, such as motion or brightness sensors, we integrate into the system to trigger the ignition of the light according to the detected conditions.

Test and adjustment:

We remain the complete functioning of the system by simulating different situations.

Adjustment of the code and components of the circuit as needed to optimise the performance and reliability of the system.

Possible applications:

Automatic lighting in a house or office.

Light alarm system for security.

Control of public lighting based on ambient light.

Integration into home automation systems for intelligent automation, etc
